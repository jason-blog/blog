	Thanks to Modern Technologies. We now have the solutions to most eyesight problems. Doctors can use different treatments — PRK, Lasik, Lasek and Intraocular lenses — to solve all types of eyesight problems while limiting the side effects. Most eye procedures are about as safe and effective as surgery can be. However, for an industry that promises clarity, many centers have kept their patients in the dark about the risks and realities. Government are of no help either as there are no restrictions on who can buy medical instruments. But most hospitals insist that doctors have some form of medical accreditation before performing eye surgery.

	Despite a good record of the surgery, thousands of people around the world get an irreversible eye operation that goes awry. The consumer-advocate website surgicaleyes.com posts a sobering series of unhappy endings —— infected corneas, triple vision, daily nausea and permanently marred eyesight. The message boards are full of people who came out of Lasik with far better vision but still in misery, handicapped by poor night vision, stinging dry eyes and worse.

	It’s vital to research the subject if you’re considering surgery. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you see things clearly.

	If you believe all the ads, after eye surgery, you’ll be able to read the bottom line of an eye chart through a brick wall. If only it were true. You may not wind up with a vision as good as is promised. Besides, you might be a poor candidate. Eye surgery still isn’t fit for people with certain severe vision problems or an eye disease. The same goes for children under 18 and pregnant women, whose eyes may be undergoing changes. So don’t be shocked if a doctor gazes into your eyes and shows you the door.

	Finally, be prepared for side effect. Some complain of dry eyes and require eye drop known as artificial tears for months. Others see halos and star bursts while driving at night. Fortunately such symptoms tend to be minor and fade away.

<p>
	Ask friends for referrals or look for a surgeon on the Internet. Whatever you do, don’t make a decision on a rock-bottom price. You have only one set of eyes.

<p>
	Ask the doctor right questions:

<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	Who will be doing the procedure? Easily available and open communication with the surgeon and his team are hallmarks of a good practice. What are your credentials? Your doctor should be certified, with extra training in the conditions of cornea. How much experience do you have? A recent study found that the rate of surgical complications for four doctor doing Lasik was 1.3 percent in their first 1,000 procedures — and 0.47 for their next 3,000 surgeries. That’s some learning curve. What’s your complication rate? The best doctors have a serious surgical complication rate below 1 percent. Be wary of surgeons who can’t answer this questions or centers that won’t give information about the doctor who will be operating on you.

	Watch out for centers that offer a low price and then charge for extras for postoperative visits. While this can be the hook these centers use to get you in the door, it doesn’t necessarily mean they are a bad deal or offer inferior care.
