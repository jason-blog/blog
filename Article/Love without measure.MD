	Freda Bright says,"Only in opera do people die for love. " It's true. You really can't love somebody to death. I've known people to die from no love, but I've never known anyone to be loved to death. We just can't love one another enough.

	The woman arrived home that evening to see a beautiful table set with their best dishes. Candles were softly glowing. Her husband had come home early and prepared a festive meal.

	Someone has said that the measure of love is when you love without measure. What this man feels for his spouse is total acceptance and love, whether she succeeds or fails．His love celebrates her victories and soothes her wounds. He stands with her, no matter what life throws in their direction. He may say that he loves her to death, but he doesn't. He loves her to life, for his love nervous is her life, like nothing else can.
