	"I was sure that I was to be killed. I became terribly nervous. I fumbled in my pockets to see if there were any cigarettes, which had escaped their search.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	I found one and because of my shaking hands, I could barely get it to my lips.
</p>
<p>
	But I had no matches, they had taken those. "
</p>
<p>
	I looked through the bars at my jailer. He did not make eye contact with me.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	I called out to him 'Have you got a light?' He looked at me, shrugged and came over to light my cigarette. " As he came close and lit the match, his eyes inadvertently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. In any case, I smiled.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	In that instant, it was as though a spark jumped across the gap between our two hearts, our two human souls. I know he didn't want to, but my smile leaped through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	"I kept smiling at him, now aware of him as a person and not just a jailer. And his looking at me seemed to have a new dimension too.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	'Do you have kids?' he asked. "
</p>
<p>
	'Yes, here, here.' I took out my wallet and nervously fumbled for the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes filled with tears.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	I said that I feared that I'd never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	"Suddenly, without another word, he unlocked my cell and silently led me out. Out of the jail, quietly and by back routes, out of the town. There, at the edge of town, he released me. And without another word, he turned back toward the town.
</p>
<p>
	<br />
</p>
<p>
	"My life was saved by a smile."
</p>
<p>
	Yes, the smile―the unaffected, unplanned, natural connection between people.
</p>
<p>
	I really believe that if that part of you and that part of me could recognize each other, we wouldn't be enemies. We couldn't have hate or envy or fear.
</p>

	“一想到自己明天就没命了，不禁陷入极端的惶恐。我翻遍了口袋，终于找到一支没被他们搜走的香烟，但我的手紧张得不停发抖，连将烟送进嘴里都成问题，而我的火柴也在搜身时被拿走了。
</p>
<p>
	“我透过铁栏望着外面的警卫，他并没有注意到我在看他，我叫了他一声：‘能跟你借个火吗？’他转头望着我，耸了耸肩，然后走了过来，点燃我的香烟。
</p>
<p>
	“当他帮我点火时，他的眼光无意中与我的相接触，这时我突然冲着他微笑。
</p>
<p>
	我不知道自己为何有这般反应，也许是过于紧张，或者是当你如此靠近另一个人，你很难不对他微笑。不管是何理由，我对他笑了。就在这一刹那，这抹微笑如同火花般，打破了我们心灵间的隔阂。受到了我的感染，他的嘴角不自觉地也现出了笑容，虽然我知道他原无此意。他点完火后并没立刻离开，两眼盯着我瞧，脸上仍带着微笑。
</p>
<p>
	“我也以笑容回应，仿佛他是个朋友，而不是个守着我的警卫。他看着我的眼神也少了当初的那股凶气，‘你有小孩吗？’他开口问道。
</p>
<p>
	“‘有，你看。’我拿出了皮夹，手忙脚乱地翻出了我的全家福照片。
</p>
<p>
	他也掏出了照片，并且开始讲述他对家人的期望与计划。
</p>
<p>
	这时我眼中充满了泪水，我说我害怕再也见不到家人。我害怕没机会看着孩子长大。
</p>
<p>
	他听了也流下两行眼泪。 “突然间，他二话不说地打开了牢门，悄悄地带我从后面的小路逃离了监狱，出了小镇，就在小镇的边上，他放了我，之后便转身往回走，不曾留下一句话。
</p>
<p>
	“一个微笑居然能救自己一条命。”“是的，微笑是人与人之间最自然真挚的沟通方式。
</p>
<p>
	如果我们能用心灵去认识彼此，世间不会有结怨成仇的憾事；恨意、妒嫉、恐惧也会不复存在。
