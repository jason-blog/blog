	It's been over eleven years now. It was a wintry afternoon, the snow swirling around the cedar trees outside, forcing little icicles to form at the tips of the deep green foliage clinging to the branches.
</p>
<p>
	My older son, Stephen, was at school, and Reed , my husband, at work .Mythree little ones were clustered around the kitchen counter, the tabletop piled high with crayons and markers. Tom was perfecting a paper airplane, creating his own insignia with stars and dtripes,while Sam worked on a self-portrait, his chubby hands drawing first a head, then legs and arms sticking out where the body should have been. The children mostly concentrated on their work, Tom occasionally tutoring his younger brother on excatly how to make a plane that would fly the entire length of the room.

	But Laura, our only daughter, sat quietly, engrossed in her project. Every once in a while she would ask how to spell the name of someone in our family, then painstakingly form the letters one by one. Next , she would add flowers with smaill green stems, complete with grass lining the bottom of the page. She finished off each with a sun in the upper right hand corner,surrounded by an inch or two of blue sky. Holding them at eye level, she let out a long sigh of satisfaction.

<p>
	"What are you making, Honey?" I asked.

	She glanced at her brothers beofre looking back at me:
</p>
<p>
	"It's a surprise," she said, covering up her work with her hands.
</p>
<p>
	Next , she taped the top two edges of each sheet of paper together trying her best to create a cylinder. When she had finished, she disappered up the stairs with her treasure.
</p>
<p>
	It wasn't until later that evening thhat I noticed a "mailbox" taped onto the doors to each of our bedrooms , there was one for Steve. There was one for Tom. She hadn't forgotten Sam or baby Paul.
</p>
<p>
	For the next few weeks, we received mail on a regular basis. There were little notes confessing her love for each of us. There were short letters full of tiny compliments that only a seven-year-old would notice. Iwas in charge of retrieving baby Paul's letteres,page after page of colored scenes including flowers with happy faces.

	"He can't read yet." she whispered, " But he can look at the pictures."
</p>
<p>
	Each time I recevied one of my little girl's gifts, it brightened my heart.
</p>
<p>
	I was touched at how carefully she observed our moods. When stephen lost a baseball game, there was a letter telling him she thought he was the best ballplayer in the whole world. After I had a particularly hard day, there was a message thanking me for my efforts, complete with a smile face tucked near the bottom corner of the page.
</p>
<p>
	This same little girl is grown now, driving off every day to the community college. But some things about her have never changed. One afternoon only a week or so ago, I found a love note next to my bedside.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
	"Thanks for always being there for me, Mom, " it read, " I'm glad that we're the best of friends."
</p>
<p>
	I couldn't help but remember the precious child whose smile has brought me countless hours of joy throughout the years. There are angels among us .
</p>
<p>
	I know , I live with one.
